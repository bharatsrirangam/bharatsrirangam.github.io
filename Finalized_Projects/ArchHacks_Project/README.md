# ArchProject
Developing an application so that Alzeihmers patients have better care at home (ie. remembering to take their medicine, organizing doctors appointments, etc).

Lambda Expressions are coded for using AWS (provided by an Amazon Student account) in the language of JavaScript. Although the project is currently only capable of adding appointments and medicines that are taken daily - with no reminders available yet - the final project will ideally help those who have early stage Alzeihmers with a complete set of usable skills.

Node.js is required for this project to work. We use lambda to work and perform our backend and server.

Latest version of NPM is also required.
```
$ sudo npm install -g npm
```
