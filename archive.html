            <p>For more than 5 years before college, I had a job at Einstein's Workshop which is a makerspace for students from K to 12th grade. I improved my communication skills by managing the questions of customers and children. I also taught children in basic skills of Scratch, NXT Design/Software, etc. I also lead/created STEM day events that focused on basic analytical and logic skills.<br><br></p>

            <p>Project Euler is a series of dedicated computational problems that help develop your computational and mathematical skills. I have completed some of the problems in my free time. You can check out my github <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/ProjectEuler">repository</a> for the problems I have finished. I don't do too much anymore - only in my free time. You can feel free to use any of my solutions.</p>

            <p>CourseTree is a web application that is meant to complement applications such as courseoff.com and Coursicle. It is often difficult for students, especially freshmen, to choose the appropriate courses and which sequential courses to take. CourseTree provides a way for students to conveniently choose and plan for future schedules. I am currently working on this website with a friend, Aiyappa Kodendera. Our contact information and progress can be seen at this <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/CourseTree/tree/dev"> link </a>. We update the "dev" branch with our code as we go along and push very final versions of code to the master branch. Prototypes stay in the dev branch.</p>

            <p>BoRats.Inc is a mobile android application that keeps track of rat sightings throughout New York City. This java app was made in our CS2340 class which aims at giving us experience with approaches to software development in the industry. I was elected Team Leader and assigned work appropriately. I held us accountable to achieve every milestone in time. We developed the application in Java using Android Studio. I implemented Google’s Firebase for multiuser backend capability and tested many of the methods with JUnit classes for quality and functionality. This project was also developed using Agile Principles and Values/Scrum. You can check out the code on our <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/boRats.Inc">repository</a>. Feel free to follow the README.md to see the application for yourself and to reference all the group members.</p>

            <p>We created and coded a version of Civilization - a turn based strategy game that was the focus of our homework in our CS 1331 Object Oriented Programming Class. We were responsible for creating a majority of the Classes and functionality of the game – including the UI. Our goal was to get use to the ideas and fundamentals of Java - encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. You can checkout the compiled code for the game at this <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/CS1331Civilization">repository</a>. Due to honor code violations, I will not be able to post the source code. If you wish to see this code please contact me personally through my email below.</p>

            <p>I took an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course the first semester of my sophomore year and in order to get some practice with Neural Networks, I wrote my own hyperplane generation neural net. My program runs a series of randomly generated points to create two sets of points that are linearly separable and then returns the equation to a plane that separates the two sets. This is done with the single perceptron algorithm. You can see the code and run the code from this <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/NeuralNetworksExperimentation">repository</a>. Feel free to use the code as you see fit.</p>

            <p>
                LocationScores is a consulting application that won 1st place for the “Best Use of ESRI’s API” at GT’s 5th Hackathon. The application used correlated wealth distribution, employment rate, etc. with existing store performances to find new optimal store locations across the United States. Application was developed using Python, Tensorflow, Keras and Pythons Requests library for efficient data collection and analysis. The actual algorithm involved was a original neural network model that took in demographic data to predict the performance of a store that would be in that location.

            <p>
                Have you ever wondered how many messages you've sent to a friend on Facebook? Maybe how many messages have been sent in a group chat? Perhaps it was more specific, such as the number of conversations or what types of conversations you've had over the last X number of months. This project, dubbed Insight, was focused on trying to provide this information to me based on my own personal messages. It is implemented in a way that anyone can supply the information of their personal messages and receive the same statistics and metric information. This project was built using Python and attemps to be as scalable as possible as I think of more and more pieces of information that would be useful to keep track of. I am also in the process of using NLP packages such as gensim and nltk to try and determine the topics of specific conversations.
