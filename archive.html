            <p>MediCheck is an app created for the Amazon Echo/Dot. Its purpose is to help patients with Alzheimer’s Disease and elderly patients with taking their medications by using Amazon’s Alexa to set checkpoints/reminders for these patients. I worked on this project with three friends at the ArchHacks Hackathon in 2016.</p>

You can check out my github <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/ProjectEuler">repository</a> for the problems I have finished. I don't do too much anymore - only in my free time. You can feel free to use any of my solutions.</p>

            <p>CourseTree is a web application that is meant to complement applications such as courseoff.com and Coursicle. It is often difficult for students, especially freshmen, to choose the appropriate courses and which sequential courses to take. CourseTree provides a way for students to conveniently choose and plan for future schedules. I am currently working on this website with a friend, Aiyappa Kodendera. Our contact information and progress can be seen at this <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/CourseTree/tree/dev"> link </a>. We update the "dev" branch with our code as we go along and push very final versions of code to the master branch. Prototypes stay in the dev branch.</p>

            <p>BoRats.Inc is a mobile android application that keeps track of rat sightings throughout New York City. This java app was made in our CS2340 class which aims at giving us experience with approaches to software development in the industry. I was elected Team Leader and assigned work appropriately. I held us accountable to achieve every milestone in time. We developed the application in Java using Android Studio. I implemented Google’s Firebase for multiuser backend capability and tested many of the methods with JUnit classes for quality and functionality. This project was also developed using Agile Principles and Values/Scrum. You can check out the code on our <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/boRats.Inc">repository</a>. Feel free to follow the README.md to see the application for yourself and to reference all the group members.</p>

            <p>We created and coded a version of Civilization - a turn based strategy game that was the focus of our homework in our CS 1331 Object Oriented Programming Class. We were responsible for creating a majority of the Classes and functionality of the game – including the UI. Our goal was to get use to the ideas and fundamentals of Java - encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. You can checkout the compiled code for the game at this <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/CS1331Civilization">repository</a>. Due to honor code violations, I will not be able to post the source code. If you wish to see this code please contact me personal through my email below.</p>

            <p>I took an Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course the first semester of my sophomore year and in order to get some practice with Neural Networks, I wrote my own hyperplane generation neural net. My program runs a series of randomly generated points to create two sets of points that are linearly separable and then returns the equation to a plane that separates the two sets. This is done with the single perceptron algorithm. You can see the code and run the code from this <a class="internal" href="https://github.com/bharatsrirangam/NeuralNetworksExperimentation">repository</a>. Feel free to use the code as you see fit.</p>
